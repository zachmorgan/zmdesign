<h1>A Selection from Around the World in 80 Days</h1>

<p>At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre.  But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. A cry of terror arose.  The whole multitude prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground.</p>

<p>The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly appearance.</p>

<p>Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there, with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy.</p>

<p>The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden.  Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied.</p>

<p>The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an abrupt tone, said, "Let us be off!"</p>

<p>It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had delivered the young woman from death!  It was Passepartout who, playing his part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the general terror.</p>

<blockquote>Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there, with their faces on the ground...</blockquote>

<p>A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. But the cries and noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg's hat, apprised them that the trick had been discovered.</p>

<p>The old rajah's body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre; and the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction had taken place.  They hastened into the forest, followed by the soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them, and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows.</p>

<p>The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success.  Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow's hand, and his master said, "Well done!" which, from him, was high commendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg.  As for him, he had only been struck with a "queer" idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah!  As for the young Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, wrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs.</p>

<p>The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, an hour after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain.  They made a halt at seven o'clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration.  The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off.  Sir Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account.  But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate.  He told Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners.  These fanatics were scattered throughout the county, and would, despite the English police, recover their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta.  She would only be safe by quitting India for ever.</p>
