# [Space Website](https://space.com)

This is one of my favorite sites to find current events and news on anything to do with the science or exploration of space. I find the visual style of the site to be pleasing, but kept in a clean simple color scheme and layout that is easy to follow in reading for what information you want. One of the key features I like most is their content slider which contains one news article image and below there are list of current article title along with the previous and next article.

The site is a fixed width site with an alternative [mobile site](https://m.space.com)

## First Impressions on the coding

There are a lot of errors for the site on the validator. When looking at the coding I see lots of iframes and could not figure where the main page of content started. There are a lot of javascript files that are for Google Tag Manager and Analytics. Some of the iframes are social addons such as twitter along with ones for iframes.

* Found the main content in a div called ie6_wrapper.
* All the div classes are well named so you know what they are.
* CSS is broken down into two files; the site one contains all the layout and style for all the pages and the home file is specifically for Home page layout.
* The CSS file are well commented structure.

## Turning off JavaScript

I find that it only breaks the content slider for the rotating part. However the contents in the slider can be found on other parts of the site. I found all other parts of site work such as search and their store.

## Turning off CSS

When css is disabled the topbar dissappears, S the social icons and logo goes away. The slider explodes and has the first link text that still rotates if javascript is available. All the images are listed below in order with alt text available. Overall the structure ist there well to be able to navigate well. The news sections below are listed in order in their individual sections. The social icons all go to the bottom.
