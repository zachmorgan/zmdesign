    <p>A funeral home that sits inside of a Victorian era house with a website that looks like a plain professional uptight business. The design need to be brought back in line with the style and feel of the business.</p>
    <p>The client has selected a template as a starting place. A layout was finalized to their businessâ€™s needs. Color style was created towards green tones of the era. An unique custom wallpaper background was made for the style and enhances the website without being distracting.</p>
