    <h2>McKnight Family Funeral Firms</h2>
    <p>A family owned funeral that operated three different locations with each their own website. Each site had a design that had no relation to the other and the customers could not tell they were run by the same people.</p>

    <p>A combined site was created with one design direction with listings of their locations. The client liked a design style that was used in a different website designed by FuneralNet. A site design and layout was created in combination with previous designs and the geographical region that the company resides.</p>

    <p>Past and current customers of the companies now have less confusion of the different locations and now feel more welcome to the design style. As well as new customers who wonâ€™t feel lost seeing the different, but similarly named locations.</p>
