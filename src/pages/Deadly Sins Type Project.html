    <h2>Deadly Sins &#124; Type Design</h2>
    <p>Wel&#45;developed hierarchy in a represented theme from the seven deadly sins with several represented articles pertaining to a theme along with visualizing thoughts on font selection represent emotions and ideals.</p>

    <p>A darker theme was created to visualize the selected &#39;wrath&#39; theme from the deadly sins. Dark blood red became the top level for hierarchy followed by a dark grey. Custom JavaScript to make bubble like objects rising to represent conspiring thoughts with an old European architecture city in the background. Various levels were created for the articles to show flow from the two font type Raleway and Merriweather with title size and section spacing.</p>

    <p>The visuals of the articles fitted the thematic of wrath, but the flow of each article is long and strenuous. Each needs more partitions for easy pacing and a way to move onto the next article.</p>
