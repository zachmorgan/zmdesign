    <h2>Wheel to Walk Foundation</h2>
    <p>A strong non&#45;profit foundation with plenty of ties to the local community that supports children with disabilities to cover costs of medical equipment and services not covered by insurances. Knowledge about them is more so by word of mouth and reviews outside of their website that may not cover everything and it is where they obtain the form.</p>

    <p>A CMS site was designed a built to incorporate all the features about the foundation into one place. Easier ways to communicate with the staff and obtaining forms. Included all the testimonials about the foundation. Displayed several ways the foundation accepted donation and who their partners are.</p>

    <p>In the end there was easier management of the filled out forms and more of the community interacted with the foundation with more testimonials and pictures of those who were helped.</p>
