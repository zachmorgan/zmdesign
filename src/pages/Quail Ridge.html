    <h2>Quail Ridge Shade Trees, LLC</h2>
    <p>A Oregon company that has been in the business for over twenty years in selling trees to their contractor clients by word of mouth, listings and monthly inventory email. They have decided to take the next steps to provide clients with ease of access to information in the modern industries.
    <p>At the time they had no website and wanted to deliver inventories in a way that was much easier to read and accessible. They wanted to get away from the old mom and pop shop feel of their company.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebranding the company and its logo was needed.</li>
      <li>A style guide was created the following the branding.</li>
      <li>Several iteration of site design was created to fit their needs.</li>
      <li>A custom inventory system was created.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The company is now able to promote their products further with ease of use inventory search to purchase those trees. The inventory system resulted in the ease of updating their products allowing more time to be spent on raising trees.</p>
